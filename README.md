# Tableau-Paid-Holidays-by-Country
# In this project I will working on visualizing paid holidays by country

## 1 Firstly I have created sheet that shows difference in holidays with other countries when you click on one country
### Here I have clicked on San Marino which is 2nd after Iran, it shows that Iran has 7 days more holidays than it.
